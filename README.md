# MatrixANN

One of my assignments in second year was to create an artificial neural network that could predict rainfall levels without the use of libraries. This meant coding the network structure and backpropagation myself. Unfortunately, like a dumbass, I didn't save the code I wrote to github. Because I hate myself and want to relearn machine learning, this is a recreation of that coursework, using matrices as the underlying data structure used to represent the network and the calculations.
